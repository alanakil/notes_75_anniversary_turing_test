# Notes: 75th Anniversary of the Turing Test, a celebration
On 2 October 2025, I attended the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Turing test. The Turing test was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper which he started by raising the question: "Can machines think?", which remains quite relevant to this day.

The event was co-organised by the Royal Society and the University of Southampton and it brought together leading voices to reflect on the influence and future of Turing's test.
There were amazing speakers including Alan Kay, Gary Marcus, and Nigle Shadbolt, among others, and very interesting panel discussions about the future of the Turing Test and AGI.

Hearing from these remarkable minds was an incredible experience, and I've taken some notes from the keynotes and the panel discussion that I make available here.
